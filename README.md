### Step 1

- Install and configure Apollo Client
- Wrap you index.js with it
- I personally make a new component and add it in the App.js
- We import useQuery and gql to be able to read our data
- We make a query and save our data
- With our useQuery hook we destructure the important values we need
- Map and get the values you need,( good practice to destructure your elements already in the map callback, i really liked that!)
